1. Start new conversations more frequently. The agent does better when it's a little more focused, and when there's a ton of random unrelated context put together, it can be harder to sift through the noise. It can be ADHD unless you get it to focus on the task at hand
2. Be a little more clear in your requests. The better you articulate yourself, the more context on the problem that the agent will have, which increases the likelihood it can solve your problem.
3. Prompt to integrate perplexity (in a new chat thread):
    -Okay, I've been trying to implement Perplexity as my "Agent" to find jobs for my users, and am getting a little stuck. The end goal is for users to be able to input their criteria for the types of jobs they are looking for, and to use Perplexity's API to search for those jobs, gathering a breakdown of what the job is, and then linking out to it via my job cards. I want to actually implement an intermediary step with GPT-5-mini where GPT-5-mini takes all of the results that Perplexity comes back with, and turns it into structured <xml> such that it can be easily parsed into the different categories I'm collecting, and then display that information correctly to the user. For the gpt-5-mini prompt, we want to make sure that it is given an example for what we are looking for, told its job, and then is piped all of the context from Perplexity to organize into the correct categories (i.e. url link to job, job title, summary, etc.). My app is a bit of a mess right now: can you clean it up so that it works correctly? Feel free to change things up and get rid of old, obsolete code so that we're coding modularly, making it easier to edit the code in the future.
